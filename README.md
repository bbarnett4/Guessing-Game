The purpose of this project for one was to get a good grade on a assignment in a course.  Besides that it was a very fun project that I enojoyed doing.  This type of project really caught my eye because it kept me interested in the career path I am trying to pursue.  Hopefully I this type of project will motivate me to create many more games in the future. This project uses a variety of loops and if-else statements. This project only asks for the user input, no other files are needed.
